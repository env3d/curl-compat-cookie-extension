# curl-compat-cookie-extension

A basic chrome extension that allows arbitrary reading and
writing of cookies from/to any website using
a curl compatible cookie string.

Great for doing demos on how cookies work.

Get it from the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-curl-compatible-co/hacpnjlfmfaiedcejmognhhffdpooafe)
